        <h2 class="process">For the creation of the shower gel, we first had to be given an concept that ended to be classical, rich and secretive.
            After that the apropriate move is to find everything associated with the concept and then gather information about the same.
            Moving forward, the plan becomes more coherent, since we start to create a moodboard with everything we want our product to resemble or transmit.
            After that was straight into idealization and creation of the shower gel.

       <h2 class="process">After establishing the final look of the bottle, the design of the brand needed to be done.
          Therefore, creating logos, images that fit into our concept was needed.
          After we achieve the desired logo, we printed the logos and 3d printed the shower gel to have a phisical 
          product that we can evaluate.
